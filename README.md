# CryptoClustering
Python and Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning) to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
In this analysis, we use the k-means algorithm and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods to see how normalize data can affect data segmentation or clustering.
